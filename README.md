All photos and movies are in data folder
## Bit
In the provided image, the caption is encoded on the youngest bit.
Perform operations to modify the image in a way allowing the encoded caption to be read.

## Candy
Design and implement a method to find a selected type of candy in a provided image.

## Canny
Use the mouse on any image - create a rectangle with two clicks, and then inside the rectangle perform the edge finding operation using Canny's algorithm.

## Circles
Surround the red circles with a blue border and the blue circles with a red border. Write out the number of red and blue circles.

## Color negative
Load any color image, select two points with the mouse, and perform a negative operation on the area outside the rectangle defined by the clicked points. You should be able to do this operation many times.

## Crown
Label the jewels of any color you choose in the crown of kings.

## Currency
Coins of denomination 5 zloty and 1 gr are placed in the picture. Determine the number of each type of coin and label it 
by a colored border on the picture (red for the coins of 5 zloty and green for the coins of 1 gr).

## Negative
Display the loaded color image in a window;
add a slider to the window.
Moving the slider determines which part of the displayed
e.g. extreme left position - image unchanged,
extreme right position - image unchanged
- the negative image itself,
halfway position - left 50% of the image unchanged,
right 50% of the image negative.
The whole image should change smoothly, depending on the position of the slider.

## Rotate
Display the loaded color image in a window; add mouse support to the window.
Click the left button to rotate the of the four image fragments created by passing a horizontal and vertical line through the clicked point.
Clicking anywhere with the right key resets the layout and returns to the original image.

## Scaling
Calculate the spline of the filter given by the equation in M matrix with the grayscale source image.
From the result, extract the value of the absolute, scale it to a range of values from 0 to 255, and display it.

## Sign
Design and implement a method to find the straight ahead order sign in provided images.

## Tiger
Change the color of the corresponding parts of the tiger to orange
(we assume that the gray color throughout the image has the same level).

## Movie
Open the video sequence provided. Detect moving objects and surround them with a red rectangle.
